Grr was written by Daniel Walker.
The beta version was released on September 8, 2020.

Grr takes a regex and searches a directory tree for files containing strings
which match that regex.  All lines which contain a match are printed to the
screen in the following format:

(5) some/directory/file.txt (line 97) : ... k19jIMATCHTHEREGEXkjljlk ...

The "(5)" is a result number.  The first result printed will be numbered 0,
then 1, and so on.  The purpose of this numbering system will be explained
below under the "-l" option description.

=== USAGE ===

grr <regex> [options]

Options:
    -d <directory>       Specifies the starting directory.  Defaults to the
                         present working directory.
    -f <regex>           Specifies a regex for matching against the file names
                         which are searched.  Only files which contain a
                         substring which matches the regex will be searched.
    -n                   Only print the names of the files which contain
                         matches.
    -l <result-number>   Instead of printing the results to the screen, the
                         file denoted by the specified result number will be
                         opened in an editor.  The editor used can be set via
                         the DEFAULT_EDITOR environment variable or by using
                         the -f option.  If neither are set, vi/m will be used.
                         In the case that vi/m is used, the file will be opened
                         to the line containing the match (or the first line if
                         the -n option was used).
    -e <editor>          Specifies the editor to be used with the -l option.
                         Has no effect if -l is not used.
    -i                   The directory tree search will ignore all hidden files
                         and folders.
    -c                   Ordinarily, the substring within the file which
                         matched the regex is printed in red.  This option
                         disables that coloration.
    -v                   Prints verbose output to stderr.
    -h                   Displays these options.

=== REGEX GRAMMAR ===

The only special character classes implemented are \d (digits) and \s (spaces
and tabs).

Grr's regex engine does not support group capturing and so all text within
parentheses are considered a non-capturing group.

Braces (i.e., { and }) can only be used to specify an exact quantity.
