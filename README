Grr was written by Daniel Walker.
Version 2.0.0 was released on September 22, 2020.

Grr takes a regex and searches a directory tree for files containing strings
which match that regex.  All lines which contain a match are printed to the
screen in the following format:

(5) some/directory/file.txt (line 97) : ... k19jIMATCHTHEREGEXkjljlk ...

The "(5)" is a result number.  The first result printed will be numbered 0,
then 1, and so on.  The purpose of this numbering system will be explained
below under the "-l" option description.

=== USAGE ===

grr [options]

Options:
    -r <regex>           Specifies the search regex.  Required unless either -u
                         or -h is used.
    -d <directory>       Specifies the starting directory.  Defaults to the
                         present working directory.
    -f <regex>           Specifies a regex for matching against the file names
                         which are searched.  Only files which contain a
                         substring which matches the regex will be searched.
    -n                   Only print the names of the files which contain
                         matches.
    -l <result-number>   Instead of printing the results to the screen, the
                         file denoted by the specified result number will be
                         opened in an editor.  The editor used can be set via
                         the EDITOR environment variable or by using the -f
                         option.  If neither are set, vi/m will be used. In the
                         case that vi/m is used, the file will be opened to the
                         line containing the match (or the first line if the -n
                         option was used).
    -e <editor>          Specifies the editor to be used with the -l option.
                         Has no effect if -l is not used.
    -i                   The directory tree search will ignore all hidden files
                         and folders.
    -y                   Neither read from nor write to the history file.  See
                         "HISTORY FILE" below.
    -c                   Ordinarily, the substring within the file which
                         matched the regex is printed in red.  This option
                         disables that coloration.
    -v                   Prints verbose output to stderr.
    -u                   Prints Grr's version.
    -h                   Prints the usage information.

=== HISTORY FILE ===

When doing a normal search (i.e., not using the -l option), a history file
named .grr_history is created in the $HOME directory.  The results of the query
in addition to its starting directory, regex, and search options are written to
the file.  If the next invocation of Grr uses the same search parameters but
includes the -l option, Grr merely uses the results stored in the history file
in order to fetch the file to be opened.  The directory tree is therefore not
searched.  The next time Grr is run without the -l option, the contents of the
history file will be overwritten.

You can disable the use of the history file via the -y option.  This is useful
in the case that the directory tree's contents have changed since the last
search.

=== REGEX GRAMMAR ===

The only special character classes implemented are \d (digits) and \s (spaces
and tabs).

Grr's regex engine does not support group capturing and so all text within
parentheses are considered a non-capturing group.

Braces (i.e., { and }) can only be used to specify an exact quantity.
