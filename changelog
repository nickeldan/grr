2.2.0:
    - Fixed a bug where the temporary history file wasn't getting unlinked if Grr failed.
    - The Grr engine is now a separate repository.  Grr uses GrrEngine 2.0.0 which includes a slight
      performance increase.

2.1.0:
    - Replaced GRR_PATH_MAX with PATH_MAX.
    - Fixed a bug where using the -l option when the history file didn't exist would generate an error.
    - Added the -p option.
    - Symbolic links are no longer followed.

2.0.0:
    - The -e option now uses the EDITOR environment variable instead of the DEFAULT_EDITOR variable.
    - A history file is now used.  The -y option has been added to disable the history file's use.
    - The search pattern is now specified by the -r option.
    - Added the -u and -h options.
    - Fixed a bug in grrSearch where matches were being given the incorrect length.

1.0.1:
    - Restructured grrSearch in such a way that sped up the benchmark test by almost 200%.
    - Fixed a bug with the * quantifier that was causing endless empty transition loops.
    - Fixed a bug where grrMatch and grrSearch weren't properly processing tab characters.
